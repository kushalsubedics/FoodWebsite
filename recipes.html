                    <li class="ingredient" id="ingredient">1 onion, finely chopped</li>
                    <li class="ingredient" id="ingredient">2-3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                    <li class="ingredient" id="ingredient">1-inch piece of ginger, minced</li>

                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol class="instructions" id="instructions">
                    <li class="cooking-step" id="cooking-step"><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Gradually add water while kneading to form a smooth, elastic dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li class="cooking-step" id="cooking-step"><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine the ground meat or vegetables with the finely chopped onion, garlic, ginger, green chilies (if using), soy sauce, vegetable oil, salt, and pepper. Mix everything thoroughly. If using coriander, fold it into the mixture.</li>
                    <li class="cooking-step" id="cooking-step"><strong>Shape the Momos:</strong> Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle about 3 inches in diameter. Place a spoonful of the filling in the center of each circle. Fold the dough over the filling, pleating and pinching the edges together to seal the momo. You can shape them into half-moons or round dumplings.</li>
                    <li class="cooking-step" id="cooking-step"><strong>Cook the Momos:</strong> Arrange the momos in a steamer, making sure they don’t touch each other. Steam the momos for 10-15 minutes until the dough is cooked and the filling is tender.</li>
                    <li class="cooking-step" id="cooking-step"><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the hot momos with a dipping sauce like soy sauce, chili sauce, or a homemade tomato-coriander chutney.</li>

                    <li class="cooking-step" id="cooking-step"><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a bowl, mix the chicken pieces with half of the minced garlic, half of the minced ginger, yogurt, and a pinch of salt. Cover and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (you can also refrigerate it overnight for better flavor).</li>
                    <li class="cooking-step" id="cooking-step"><strong>Cook the Curry:</strong> Heat the vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds and bay leaf, and let them sizzle for a few seconds until fragrant. Add the finely chopped onions and cook until they turn golden brown. Add the remaining minced garlic and ginger, and sauté for another minute. Add the pureed tomatoes and green chilies (if using), and cook until the oil starts to separate from the tomato mixture. Stir in the coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and paprika (if using). Cook the spices for a minute, stirring constantly. Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pan and mix well with the spices. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the chicken is no longer pink. Pour in a cup of water (adjust according to the desired consistency) and bring the curry to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and the flavors have melded together. Stir in the garam masala and adjust the salt to taste. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
                    <li class="cooking-step" id="cooking-step"><strong>Serve:</strong> Garnish the chicken curry with fresh coriander leaves. Serve hot with steamed rice, naan, or roti.</li>
